# Dysgraphia Detection 

This repository contains the code and dataset sample ( download link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ytt3Ak7ql6PdwfQiOw1DG06mERtya0ID/view?usp=sharing) for the research project "DETECTION OF DYSGRAPHIA THROUGH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS" presented and to be published in the Springer Conference 2024.

Description

Dysgraphia is a learning disability that significantly affects an individual's ability to communicate in both social and formal contexts. This condition is characterized by impairments in verbal expression, written communication, and the acquisition of knowledge, leading to substandard and distorted penmanship. Traditional approaches to addressing dysgraphia, such as individualized occupational therapy, can be expensive and time-consuming.

Our research leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between the handwriting of proficient students and individuals with dysgraphia. By applying CNN on a dataset of handwriting images, we aim to extract complex features that facilitate a more thorough examination and successful differentiation of unique handwriting patterns. This methodology shows potential for accurately identifying dysgraphia, which could lead to more focused treatments and support measures.
